### Folder name
⚠️ If you downloaded it as a zip, rename the `HelloAce-master` folder to `HelloAce`

### About embeds
The Ace3 libs are hard embedded for simplicity. For how to soft embed them, see [BigWigs: Preparing the PackageMeta File](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/packager/wiki/Preparing-the-PackageMeta-File).

They can also be used standalone / without embedding, by:
* Dropping the [Ace3](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3) addon in your `AddOns` folder.
* Specifying `## OptionalDeps: Ace3` in your TOC.
