### Folder name
⚠️ If you downloaded it as a zip, rename the `HelloAce-master` folder to `HelloAce`

### About embeds
The Ace3 libs are hard embedded for simplicity. For how to soft embed them, see [BigWigs: Preparing the PackageMeta File](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/packager/wiki/Preparing-the-PackageMeta-File).

Afterwards for your dev setup you can put your `Libs` folder in a `.gitignore` or use the Ace3 libs standalone by:
* Dropping the [Ace3](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3) addon in the `AddOns` folder.
* Specifying `## OptionalDeps: Ace3` in your TOC.
